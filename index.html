								Kaede Honjou is invited by her friend Risa Shiramine to play a virtual reality MMO game with her. While Kaede doesn't dislike games, what she really, truly dislikes is being in pain. She creates a character named Maple, and decides to put all her points in VIT to minimize pain. As a result, she moves slowly, can't use magic, and even a rabbit can get the best of her. But as it turns out, she acquires a skill known as "Absolute Defense" as a result of her pumping points into VIT, as well as a "Counter Skill" that works against special moves. Now, with her ability to nullify all damage, she goes on adventures.

							<p class="mb-2">A boy fights... for "the right death."</p>
							<p class="mb-2">Hardship, regret, shame: the negative feelings that humans feel become Curses that lurk in our everyday lives. The Curses run rampant throughout the world, capable of leading people to terrible misfortune and even death. What's more, the Curses can only be exorcised by another Curse.</p>
							<p>Itadori Yuji is a boy with tremendous physical strength, though he lives a completely ordinary high school life. One day, to save a friend who has been attacked by Curses, he eats the finger of the Double-Faced Specter, taking the Curse into his own soul. From then on, he shares one body with the Double-Faced Specter. Guided by the most powerful of sorcerers, Gojo Satoru, Itadori is admitted to the Tokyo Metropolitan Technical High School of Sorcery, an organization that fights the Curses... and thus begins the heroic tale of a boy who became a Curse to exorcise a Curse, a life from which he could never turn back.</p>

							<p>Since ancient times, humans and monsters have waged bitter war against one another in the bowels of the treacherous dungeon beneath Orario. Enmity between these races is an accepted and immutable fact — or at least it was until Bell Cranel stumbled across a young, blue-skinned girl in the dungeon’s dark depths. When this inhuman young woman speaks to him in the language of human beings and looks at him with all-too-human eyes, the land of Orario erupts into turmoil the likes of which it has never seen.</p>

							<p class="mb-2">October 31st, 2095. The southernmost tip of the Korean Peninsula was annihilated due to an unidentified Strategic-Class magic. Known as “Scorched Halloween,” this day marked the arrival of a new Strategic-Class magician who would shake up the world.</p>
							<p class="mb-2">Sensing an impending crisis, the USNA secretly deploys Stars – the most powerful magician unit in the world – in a desperate attempt to uncover the truth about the unidentified Strategic-Class magic and the magician who used it. Approximately two months later, on December 24th, as people bustle through the city decorated with Christmas lights,</p>
							<p class="mb-2">Tatsuya and his friends gather at Cafe Einebrise for a farewell party for Rei before she goes off to America as an exchange student for three months. According to her, a girl who is the same age as her will be entering Magic High School as her visiting counterpart.</p>
